# Scatter_Plot_D3JS_v2
## Second Attempt
<p>Based on the 1st attempt from https://github.com/HarpSkye/Scatter_Plot_D3JS, I decided to create personal practice and add additional feature on top of that, including:
<ul> 
  <li>Change background color</li>
  <li>Adding meaningful context, such as Country, in the tooltip</li>
  <li>Add hover effect using CSS</li>
 </ul>
 PS: You are able to find the functional page here: https://harpskye.github.io/Scatter_Plot_D3JS_v2/
